## About:

The coefficients of the model are responsible with the quality of that model. They are changing during the learning process, getting better and better, making the final form of the [[Hypothesis]].

## Notation:

$$\theta = (\theta_0, \theta_1, \text{...}, \theta_n)^t \in R^{n+1}$$^04c96a
