# Definition

A **combination** is a subset B of a set A, where A has a cardinality of n and B has a cardinality of r, $n \in \mathbb{N}, \space 1 \le r \le n$.

The number of combinations of n objects taken r at a time is denoted:

$$C_n^r$$

and equals:

$$C_n^r = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$$

# Deduction

Order doesn't matter.

So:

$$C_n^r = \frac{P_n^r}{r!}$$

Where $P_n^r$ is:
