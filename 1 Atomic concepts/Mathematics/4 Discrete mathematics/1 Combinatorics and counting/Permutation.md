A **permutation** is a sequence of r distinct objects taken r times.
We denote it with:

$$P_n^r$$

and we name it: "number of permutations of n objects taken r at a time".
If $1 \le r \le n$, then $P_n^r$, the number of permutations of n objects taken r at a time, is:

$$P_n^r = n \cdot (n-1) \cdot \space ... \space \cdot (n-(r-1))$$

And if we agree to define 0! = 1, then, $\forall \space n \ge 0$:

$$P_n^r = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$$
