# Theorem

For any two finite, nonempty sets $\text{A and B}$, $|\text{A} \times \text{B}| = |\text{A}|\space |\text{B}|$.

# Proof

---

$|\text{A}| = m$
$|\text{B}| = n$

To form an ordered pair $(\text{a},\text{b}),\space \text{a} \in \text{A}\space \text{and}\space \text{b} \in \text{B}$, we must perform two succesive tasks. Task 1 is to choose a first element of the pair from A, and task 2 is to choose the second element of the pair from B. There are m ways to perform task 1 and n ways to perform task 2. So, by the [[Multiplication principle of counting]], there are $\text{m} \times \text{n}$ ways to form an ordered pair $(\text{a},\text{b})$. In other words, the cardinality of the set $\text{A} \times \text{B}$ is: $|\text{A} \times \text{B}| = m \cdot n = |\text{A}|\space |\text{B}|$.
