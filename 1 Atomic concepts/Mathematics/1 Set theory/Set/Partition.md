# Definition

A **partition** or **quotient set** of a [[set#nonempty set]] A is a collection $\mathscr{P}$ of nonempty subsets of A such that
1. Each element of A belongs to one of the sets in $\mathscr{P}$.
2. If $\text{A}_1 \text{ and } \text{A}_2$ are distinct elements of $\mathscr{P}$, then $\text{A}_1 \cap \text{A}_2 = \emptyset$.

Since members of a partition of a set A are [[subset]]s of A, then the partition of A is a subset of the [[power set]] of A. That is, partitions can be considered as #particular kinds of subsets of power sets.

# Example

$\mathbb{Z} = \text{set of all integers,}$
$\text{A}_1 = \text{set of all even numbers, and}$
$\text{A}_2 = \text{set of all odd numbers.}$

Then, $\{ \text{A}_1, \text{A}_2 \}$ is a partition of $\mathbb{Z}$.
