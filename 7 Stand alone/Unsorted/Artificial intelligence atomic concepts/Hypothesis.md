## About:

The hypothesis is the model that is generated in the learning process, responsabile with obtaining good output values based on the input values. It is dependent on the [[Weights vector#^04c96a]].

## Notation:

$h_\theta(x) = \theta_0 \cdot  x_0 + \theta_1 \cdot x_1 + \text{...} + \theta_n \cdot x_n = \theta^t \cdot x = x^t \cdot \theta$
