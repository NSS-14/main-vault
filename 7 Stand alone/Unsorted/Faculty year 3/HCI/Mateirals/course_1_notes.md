# Introduction

A divice that allows interaction between human being and a computer is known as a "Human-compueter Interface (HCI)".

HCI is:
- the study of how people interact with computers.
- consists of three parts:
	- the users
	- the computer itself, and
	- the ways, they work together
- is concerned with understanding and improving the interaction between humans and computers to make technology more **user-friendly**, **efficient**, and **enjoyable**.
- is a subfield within computer science concerned with the study of:
	- the interaction between people (users) and computers and
	- the design, evaluation and implementation of user interfaces for computer systems that are receptive to the user's needs and habits.
- HCI = IoT + NLP + AR;

# Sensors and systems

- self-*
- A smart system is an adaptable system. He in human independent in relation with humans. He takes decisions and do actions, based on them.

# ML

IoT + ML = Intelligent and intuitive, systems;

AI - ML - DL = Artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning;

DL - NLP;

AR - VR - MR;

Partea practica a ceea ce facem, de impact.

Material de continut teoretic care bate spre aplicatii.
Sa imbine, cel mult o pagina HCI, o pagina domeniu interesant, apoi, imbinarea celor doua.
