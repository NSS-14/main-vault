# HCI-AR

## Introduction

**HCI** stands for "human computer interaction".

**AR** means augmented reality.

## What is HCI

This is a field, that studies the way we (humans), are interacting with different smart objects (computers), that exists around us.

Researchers from this field are interested to **improve** the way humans are using the technology and invent new technologies, by observing the **needs** we have.

HCI includes elements of:

- computer science 💻
- psychology 👁‍🗨
- behavioral science 📊
- ergonomics 🛠
- linguistics 🎎
- neuroscience 🧠
- cognitive engineering 💡

Examples of HCI:

- self-checkouts
- desktops, laptops, screens
- video games
- online lessons
- sending and receiving informations (calls, messages)

## What is AR

In simple words, AR is a **combination** of realities, the real one, and the **virtual** one.

The virtual word is **computer-generated**. The porpouse of the virtual world is varying, but a few examples of porpuses are:

- entertainment
- support the real world with additional informations
- the real world integration of other technologies
- education

## HCI-AR

The question is: *What's the connection between HCI and AR?*

Because HCI studies the way that humans are using technology, and AR is a technology meant to be used by humans, there should be a connection, right?

Of course it is. And AR seeks for help from the HCI field.

AR needs cameras to receive real world footage and a computer to process that footage and add the appropriate virtual flavor to the real world.

*But what is this innovative thing without the users?*

The users are the humans, and we need to receive the augmented reality somehow. HCI will find solutions for integrating this technology in the lives of humans, by pushing the limits of physics, ergonomics, computer science, and many other fields.

There are many ways we can add digital informations in the real world, using a screen, actuators, speakers and so on.

But, for AR, we need something that will enhance our vision in real time, based on a real world scenario.

AR and HCI found a solution in present, and it looks like this:

A device, that can be weread by humans, just like a pair of glasses, armed with cameras and sensors, and many other technologies that are harmoniously working togheter for one purpouse: to augument the reality.

HCI will search for better integrations of AR, and will improve the design of the current solutions.

HCI will also see how this technology will impact the health of the people, on the long run, and how beneficial it is to the society.
