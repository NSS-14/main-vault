### Non-linear equation examples:
$$\displaylines{y = x^2 \\ x \cdot y = 12 \\ \frac{5}{x} + y = 10}$$

### The definition the two-variable linear equation:
If it has the form, y to the first power with a constant coefficient = x to the first power with a constant coefficient plus a constant, then it is a two-variable linear equation:
$$c_y \cdot y = c_x \cdot x + c$$
