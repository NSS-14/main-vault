if A_1 has n_1 elements and A_2 has n_2 elements and A_3 has n_3 elements, then A_1 x A_2 x A_3 is the 3tuple made with (a_1,a_2,a_3), where a_1 in A_1, a_2 in A_2 and a_3 in A_3. so, to make all the posible tuples we dive this action in tasks.
the task1 to take one element from A_1 can be done in n_1 ways,
the task2 to take one element from A_2 can be done in n_2 ways for all n_1 ways of t1,
the task3 to take one element from A_3 can be done in n_3 ways, for all t1t2 ways so,
by multiplication principle of couting, the task t1t2t3 can be made in n1n2n3 ways, thus the cardinality of A1xA2xA3 = n1n2n3.
