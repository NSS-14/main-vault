## Notes:

The Gallant's algorithm or the "poket's" algorithm, treates the case where the training set in not linearly separable. The ideaa of the algorithm is to mantain the vector w of weights who makes the least classification errors for succesive data. When the epoch ends, there is numbered the amount of correct classifications with the current weights vector. If the number of correct classifications are coorect for the vector kept in the "poket", then the contents of the "poket" is changed to this new vector. At the begining, the poket holds the w(1). The poket always stores a weight vector and the number of correct classification that he made. The procces repets for an finite amount of times (specified). At final, the algorithm returns the vector from the poket.
