It is supposed that, there is a teacher who can present a training data set with the form (**input - assigned output**), relevant, which is taken over by the system and learned. It is used an error function, which mesures how far away is the asked answer from the answer given by the system. Based on the error, an adjustment procces takes over for the values of the computational inteligent system until the error goes down under a certain limit. The final result is a system that is able to give an appropiate output for a certain input value that was not present in the training data set.

Examples of system that are using the supervised learning:
- perceptron;
- multilayer perceptron;
- fuzzy artmap;
- networks with radial activation;
- convultional networks;

The work scheme for supervised learning:
