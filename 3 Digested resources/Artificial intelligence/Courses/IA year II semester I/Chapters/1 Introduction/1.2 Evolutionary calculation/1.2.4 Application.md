The main area of application is optimization, for situations where the search for the solution requires a long time. Genetic algorithms are used as heuristic method. The problems addressed are among the most diverse: optimization of a work plan or circuit, load balancing, ingredient optimization, automatic design, loading containers, optimization of molecular structures, mutation testing, optimization of compression systems, selection of optimal models, finding hardware defects, etc.
