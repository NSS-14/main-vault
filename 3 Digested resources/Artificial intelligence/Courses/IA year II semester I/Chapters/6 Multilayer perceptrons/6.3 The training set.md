## Notes:

The networks from this chapter are for the supervised learning. The training set is:

$$S = \{ (x^{(1)}, y^{(1)}), (x^{(2)}, y^{(2)}), ..., (x^{(p)}, y^{(p)}) \}$$

, where $x^{(i)} \in R^n$, and $y^{(i)}$ is the label associated to entry i (ground truth), by cases:

- for a regression problem: vector in $R^m$;
- for a classification problem or estimating probabilities for m calsses: vectors of the form $(1, 0, ..., 0)^t, (0, 1, 0, ..., 0)^t, ..., (0, 0, ..., 0, 1)^t$ with m binary values, from which, one of them, is one, associated to the position of the class, and the other one are 0.
