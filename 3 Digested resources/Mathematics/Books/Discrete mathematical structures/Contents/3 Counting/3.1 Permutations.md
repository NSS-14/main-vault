Example 2:
Let A be a set with n elements. How many subsets does A have?

Solution:
Because every subset of A is determined by its characteristic function, and if A has n elements, we can describe the function as an array of 0's and 1's having length n. The first element of the elemnt can be 0 or 1, and this is tru for all succeeding elemnts as well. Thus, by the extended multiplication principle, there are:
$$
\underbrace
{
2 \cdot 2 \space \cdot \space ...\space  \cdot \space 2}
_{\text{n factors}
}
= 2^n
$$
