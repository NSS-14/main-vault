- Sample spaces:

A set A consisting of all the outcomes.

To an experimet we can associate more than one sample space, depending on what the observer chooses to record as an outcome.

- Events:

The statement about the outcome of an event is called an event.

The event described by a statement = the set of all outcomes from which the statement is true.

So an event can be seen as a subset of the sample space.

- Mutually exclusive events:

The subsets from the sample space that composes the events are disjoint.

- Examples:
