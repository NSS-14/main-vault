Problem 2:
Let A be a set with n elements and $1 \le r \le n$. How many different subsets of A are there, each with r elements.

Example 1:
Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4}.
The following are all distinc combinations of A, taken three at a time:
{1, 2, 3}; {1, 2, 4}; {1, 3, 4}; {2, 3, 4}.

Example 3:
Compute the number of distinct five-card hands that can be delt from a deck of 52 cards.
Solution:
$C_{52}^5 = \frac{52!}{5!(52-5)!} = \frac{52 \cdot 51 \cdot 50 \cdot 49 \cdot 48 \cdot 47!}{5! \cdot 47!} = \frac{26 \cdot 17 \cdot 10 \cdot 49 \cdot 12}{1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1} = 2.598.960$
