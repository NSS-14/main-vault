### Definitions:

A **recurrence relation** is a recursive formula.
The beginning of a sequence is called the **initial condition** or **conditions** for the sequence.

### Examples:

(a) The recurrence relation $a_n = a_{n-1} + 3$, with $a_1 = 4$ recursively defines the sequence 4, 7, 10, 13, ...

(b) The recurrence relation $f_n = f_{n - 1} + f_{n - 2}, f_1 = f_2 = 1$ defined the **Fibonacci sequence** 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...

### Backtracking:

$a_n = a_{n - 1} + 3$ with $a_1 = 2$ defines the sequence 2, 5, 8, ... . We backtrack the value of $a_n$ by substituting the definition of $a_{n - 1}, \space a_{n - 2},$ and so on, until a pattern is clear.

### Linear homogeneous relation of degree k:

A recurrence relation is in the **linear homogeneous relation of degree k** form if:

$$a_n = r_1a_{n-1} + r_2a_{n-2} + ... + r_ka_{n-k}$$ ^e8a4bb

,where $r_i$'s are constants.

### Examples:

(a) The relation $c_n = (-2)c_{n-1}$ is a linear homogeneous recurrence relation of degree 1.

(b) The relation $a_n = a_{n-1} + 3$ is not a linear homogeneous recurrence relation.

(c) The recurrence relation $f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}$ is a linear homogeneous relation of degree 2.

(d) The recurrence relation $g_n = g_{n-1}^2 + g_{n-2}$ is not a linear homogeneous relation of degree 2.

### Characteristic equation:

For a linear homogeneous recurrence relation of degree k:

![[3.5 Reccurence relations#^e8a4bb]]

, we call the **associated polynomial** of degree k:

$$x^k = r_1x^{k-1} + r_2x^{k-2} + {...} + r_k$$

, its **characterisitic equation**.

The roots of the characteristic equation play a key role in the explicit formula for the sequence defined by the recurrence relation and the initial conditions. While the problem can be solved in general, we give a theorem for degree 2 only. Here it is common to write the characteristic equation as:

$$x^2 - r_1x - r_2 = 0$$ ^0fc1ba

#### Theorem 1:

(a) If the characteristic equation

![[3.5 Reccurence relations#^0fc1ba]]

of the recurrence relation

$$a_n = r_1a_{n-1} + r_2a_{n-2}$$

has two distinct roots, $s_1$ and $s_2$, then $a_n = us_1^n + vs_2^n$, where u and v depend on the initial conditions, is the explicit formula for the sequence.

(b) If the characteristic equation has a single root s, then the explicit formula is $a_n = us^n + vns^n$, where u and v depend on the initial conditions.

Proof:

(a) Suppose that $s_1^2 - r_1s_1 - r_2 = 0, \space s_2^2 - r_1s_2 - r_2 = 0$, and $a_n = us_1^n + vs_2^n$, for $n \ge 1$. We show that this definition of $a_n$ defines the same sequence as $a_n = r_1a_{n-1} + r_2a_{n-2}$. First, we note that u and v are chosen so that $a_1 = us_1 + vs_2$ and $a_2 = us_1^2 + vs_2^2$ and the initial conditions are satisfied. Then:
