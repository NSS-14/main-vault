## Notes:

### Mathematical structure:
 A collection of objects with operations defined on them and the
accompanying properties form a **mathematical structure** or **system**.

### Example 1:
 The collection of sets with the operations of union, intersection, and
complement and their accompanying properties is a (**discrete**) **mathematical structure**. We denote this structure by: $[\text{sets}, \cup, \cap, \overline{}]$.

### Example 2:
 The collection of 3 x 3 matrices with the operations of addition,
multiplication, and transpose is a **mathematical structure** that is
denoted by: $[\text{3 x 3 matrices}, +, *, ^T]$.

### Closure property of mathematical structures:
 A **mathematical structure** is **closed with respect to** an operation if
that operation always produces another member of the collection of
objects.

### Example 3:
 The structure $[\text{5 x 5 matrices}, +, *, ^T]$ is **closed** with respect to addition
because the sum of any two 5 x 5 matrices is another 5 x 5 matrix.

### Example 4:
 The structure $[\text{odd integers}, +, *]$ is not **closed** with respect to addition.
The sum of two odd integers is an even integer. This structure does have the closure property for multiplication, since the product of two odd numbers is an odd number.

### Binary and unary operations:
 An operation that combines two objects is a **binary operation**.
An operation that requires only one object is a **unary operation**.

### Example 5:
 - Set intersection is a **binary operation**, since it combines two sets to
produce a new set.
 - Producing the transpose of a matrix is a **unary operation**.

### Common properties of operations:
 Common properties have been given names. *For example, if the order
of the objects does not affect the outcome of binary operation, we say that operation is **commutative**. That is, if $\text{x } \Box \text{ y} = \text{y } \Box \text{ x}$, where $\Box$ is some binary operation, $\Box$ is commutative.

### Example 6:
 - Join and meet for boolean matrices are commutative operations.
$$\text{A} \lor \text{B} = \text{B} \lor \text{A} \hspace{1em} \text{and} \hspace{1em} \text{A} \land \text{B} = \text{B} \land \text{A}$$
 - Ordinary matrix multiplication is not a commutative operation.
$$\text{AB} \neq \text{BA}$$

### The property of an operation:
 When we say an operation has a property, this mean that the
statement of the property is true when the operation is used with any objects in the structure. If there is even one case when the statement is not true, the operation does not have that property.
 If $\Box$ is a binary operation, then $\Box$ is **associative** or **has the associative
property if**:
$$\text{(x } \Box \text{ y) } \Box \text{ z} = \text{x } \Box \text{ (y } \Box \text{ z)}$$

### Example 7:
 Set union is an associative operation, since $\text{(A } \cup \text{ B) } \cup \text{ C} =$
$\text{A } \cup \text{ (B } \cup \text{ C)}$ is always true.

### Distributive property:
 If a mathematical structure has two binary operations, say $\Box$ and $\bigtriangleup$, a **distributive property** has the following pattern:
$$\text{x } \Box \text{ (y } \bigtriangleup \text{ z)} = \text{(x } \Box \text{ y) } \bigtriangleup \text{ (x } \Box \text{ z)}$$

### Example 8:
 - If a,b, and c are real numbers, then $a \cdot (b + c) = a \cdot b + a \cdot c$.
 - The structure $[\text{sets}, \cup, \cap, \overline{}]$ has two distributive properties.
$$\text{A } \cup \text{ (B } \cap \text{ C)} = \text{(A } \cup \text{ B) } \cap \text{ (A } \cup \text{ C)}$$
$$and$$
$$\text{A } \cap \text{ (B } \cup \text{ C)} = \text{(A } \cap \text{ B) } \cup \text{ (A } \cap \text{ C)}$$

### De Morgan's laws:
 For some structures we can ask whether **De Morgan's laws** are
properties of the system. If the unary operation is $^*$ and the binary operations are $\Box$ and $\bigtriangleup$, then **De Morgan's laws** are:
$$(x \space \Box \space y)^* = x^* \bigtriangleup \space y^* \hspace{1em} and \hspace{1em} (x \space \bigtriangleup \space y)^* = x^* \space \Box \space y^*$$

### Example 9:
 - Sets satisfy De Morgan's laws for union, intersection, and
complement: $\overline{(A \cap B)} = \overline{A} \cup \overline{B} \space and \space \overline{(A \cup B)} = \overline{A} \cap \overline{B}$.
 - The structure $[\text{real numbers}, +, \cdot, \sqrt{\hspace{0.5em}}]$ does not satisfy De Morgan's
laws, since $\sqrt{x + y} \neq \sqrt{x} \cdot \sqrt{y}$.

### The identity for an operation:
 A structure with a binary operation $\Box$ may contain a distinguished
object, **e**, with property $x \space \Box \space e = e \space \Box \space x = x$. We call **e** an **identity** for $\Box$.
In fact, an identity for an operation must be unique.

### Theorem 1:
 If e is an identity for a binary operation $\Box$, then e is unique.
 Proof:
 Assume another object o also has the identity property, so
$x \space \Box \space o = o \space \Box \space x = x$. Then $e \space \Box \space o = e$, but since e is an identity for $\Box$, $o \space \Box \space e = e \space \Box \space o = o$. Thus o = e. There is at most one object with the identity property for $\Box$. $\color{LawnGreen}{\blacksquare}$

### Example 10:
 For the structure $[\text{n x n matrices}, +, \cdot, ^T]$, $I_n$ is the identity for matrix
multiplication, and the n x n zero matrix is the identity for matrix addition.
 If a binary operation $\Box$ has an identity e, we say that y is a $\Box$-**inverse**
of x if $x \space \Box \space y = y \space \Box \space x = e$.

### Theorem 2:
 If $\Box$ is an associative operation and x has a $\Box$-inverse y, then y is
unique.
 Proof:
 Assume that there is another $\Box$-inverse for x, say i. Then $(i \space \Box \space x) \space \Box \space y =$
$e \space \Box \space y = y$ and $i \space \Box \space (x \space \Box \space y) = i \space \Box \space e = i$. Since $\Box$ is associative, $(i \space \Box \space x) \space \Box \space y$$= i \space \Box \space (x \space \Box \space y)$, and so y = i. $\color{LawnGreen}{\blacksquare}$

### Example 11:
 - In the structure $[\text{3 x 3 matrices},+,\cdot,^T]$, each matrix $A = [a_{ij}]$ has a $+$
-inverse, or additive inverse, $-A = [-a_{ij}]$.
 - In the structure $[\text{integers},+,\cdot]$, only the integers 1 and -1 have
multiplicative inverses.

### Example 12:
 Let $\Box, \space \bigtriangleup, \space and \space\space \overline{}$ be defined for the set {0, 1} by the following tables:
 <span class="centered-images">![[Draft_19-07-2023_16.38.38.excalidraw]]</span>
 Thus $1 \space \Box \space 0 = 1$, $0 \space \bigtriangleup \space 1 = 0$, and $\overline{1}=0$.
 Determine if each of the following is true for $[\space \text{\{0,1\}},\Box,\bigtriangleup,\overline{} \space]$.
 (a) $\Box$ is commutative.
 (b) $\bigtriangleup$ is associative.
 (c) De Morgan's laws hold.
 (d) Two distributive properties hold for the structure. ^f7a980
 ---
 Solution:
 (a) The statement $x \space \Box \space y = y \space \Box \space x$ must be true for all choices of x and y.
Hence, there is only one case to check: Is $0 \space \Box \space 1 = 1 \space \Box \space 0$ true? Since the answer is yes, the $\Box$ is commutative. $\color{LawnGreen}{\blacksquare}$

 (b) We have to check eight possible cases for which $(x \space \bigtriangleup \space y) \space \bigtriangleup \space z =$
$x \space \bigtriangleup \space (y \space \bigtriangleup \space z)$:
 <span class="centered-images">![[Draft_19-07-2023_17.09.21.excalidraw]]</span>
And, as we can see, they are all true, so the $\bigtriangleup$ is associative. $\color{LawnGreen}{\blacksquare}$ ^db2c51

 (c) We have to check 4 possible cases to state that De Morgan's
laws are holding in the system, thus, we have to show that $\overline{(x \space \Box \space y)} = \overline{x} \space \bigtriangleup \space \overline{y}, \space \forall \space x, \space and \space y; \space x, \space y \space \in \space \{0, \space 1\}$:
 <span class="centered-images">![[Draft_19-07-2023_17.31.21.excalidraw]]</span>
 We have found case 4, that shows that there is x, y $\in$ {0, 1}, such
that $\overline{(x \space \Box \space y)} \neq \overline{x} \space \bigtriangleup \space \overline{y}$, in other words, De Morgan's laws are not holding in the structure. $\color{LawnGreen}{\blacksquare}$ ^9ebe11

 (d) There are two possibile distributive properties inside the
structure:
$$x \space \Box \space (y \space \bigtriangleup \space z) = (x \space \Box \space y) \space \bigtriangleup \space (x \space \Box \space z)$$
$$and$$
$$x \space \bigtriangleup \space (y \space \Box \space z) = (x \space \bigtriangleup \space y) \space \Box \space (x \space \bigtriangleup \space z)$$
 For us to verify both in an efficient way, we will construct a table:
 <span class="centered-images">![[Draft_19-07-2023_18.13.17.excalidraw]]</span>
 From the table, we see that here are rows with diffrent values for
$x \space \Box \space (y \space \bigtriangleup \space z) \space and \space (x \space \Box \space y) \space \bigtriangleup \space (x \space \Box \space z)$, so we are not having two possible distributive properties inside the system.
