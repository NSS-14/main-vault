#StatementDefintion :
>declarative sentence that is either true or false, but noth both

---

#PropositionalVariable:
>letter denoting a statement

---

#CompoundStatements :
>statement obtained by combining two or more statements by a logical connective

---

#LogicalConnectives :
>not(~), and($\land$), or($\lor$), if then($\to$), if and only if($\leftrightarrow$)

---

#Conjunction :
>$p \land q \space (p \space and \space q)$

---

#Disjunction :
>$p \lor q \space (p \space or \space q)$

---

#Predicate :
>a sentence of the form P(x)

---

#UniversalQuantification :
>$\forall \space x \space P(x) \space \text{[For all values of x, P(x) is true]}$

---

#ExistentialQuantification :
>$\exists \space x \space P(x) \space \text{[There exists an x such that P(x) is true]}$

---

#ConditionalStatement :
>$p \to q \space$ (if p then q); p is the antecedent or hypothesis and q is the consequent or conclusion

---

#ConverseOfTheImplication :
> $p \to q : q \to p$

---

#ContrapositiveOfTheImplication :
>$p \to q : (\sim q) \to (\sim p)$

---

#Equivalence :
>$p \leftrightarrow q$

---

#Tautology :
>a statement that is true for all possible values of its propositional variables

---

#Absurdity:
>a statement that is false for all posible values of its propositional variables

---

#Contingency:
>a statement that may be true or false, depending on the truth values of its propositional variables

---

#LogicallyEquivalentStatements:
>$p \equiv q$

---

#MethodsOfProof:
>q logically follows from p: [[Discrete mathematical structures.pdf#page=58]]
>rules of inference: [[Discrete mathematical structures.pdf#page=59]]
>modus ponens: [[Discrete mathematical structures.pdf#page=60]]
>indirect method: [[Discrete mathematical structures.pdf#page=61]]
>proof by contradiction: [[Discrete mathematical structures.pdf#page=61]]

---

#Counterexample:
>single instance that disproves a theorem or proposition

---

#PrincipleOfMathematicalInduction:
>let $n_0$ be a fixed integer. Suppose that for each integer $n \ge n_0$ we have a proposition P($n$). Suppose that (a) P($n_0$) is true and (b) if P($k$) $\to$ P($k+1$) is a tautology for every $k \ge n_o$. Then the principle of mathematical induction states that P($n$) is true for all $n \ge n_0$.

#LoopInvariant:
>a statement that is true before and after every pass through a programming loop
