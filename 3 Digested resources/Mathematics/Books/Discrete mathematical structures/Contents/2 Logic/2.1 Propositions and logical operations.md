## Notes:

### Statement:
A **statement** or **proposition** is a declarative sentence that is either **true** or **false**, but not both.

### Example 1:

### Logical connectives and compound statements:
The letters p, q, r, ... denote **propositional variables**, that is, variables that can be replaced by statements. Thus we can write p:The sun is shining today. q:It is cold. Statements or propositional variables can be combined by **logical connectives** to obtain **compound statements**. For example, we may combine the preceding statements by the connective 'and' to form the compound statement p and q:The sun is shining and it is cold. The truth value of a compund statement depends only on the truth values of the satements being combined and on the types of connectives being used. We shall now look at the most important connectives.

### Negation:
If p is a statement, the **negation** of p is the statement **not** p, denoted by ~p. Thus ~p is the statement "it is not the case that p". From this definition, it follows that if p is true, then ~p is false, and if p is false, ~p is true. The truth value of ~p relative to p is given in Table 2.1. Such a table, giving the truth values of a compound statement in terms of its component parts, is called a **truth table**.
![[Draft_25-07-2023_20.56.33.excalidraw]]
Streactly speacking, **not** is not a connective, since it does not join two statements, and ~p is not really a compound statement. However, **not** is a unary operation for the collection of statements, and ~p is a statement if p is. ^9ad742

### Conjunction:
If p and q are statements, the **conjunction** of p and q is the compound statement "p and q", denoted by $p \land q$. The connective **and** is denoted by the symbol $\land$. **And** is a binary operation on the set of statements. The compond statement $p \land q$ is true when both p and q are true, otherwise, it is false. The truth values of $p \land q$ in terms of the truth values of p and of q are given in the truth table shown in Table 2.2.

### Example 3:
![[Draft_25-07-2023_21.40.55.excalidraw]]

### Disjunction:
If p and q are statements, the **disjunction** of p and q is the compound statement "p or q", denoted by $p \lor q$. The connective **or** is denoted by the symbol $\lor$. The compound statement $p \lor q$ is true if at least one of p or q is true, it is false when both p and q are false. The truth values of $p \lor q$ are given in the truth table shown in Table 2.3.

### Predicate:
In [[1.1 Sets and subsets]], we defined sets by specifying a property P(x) that elements of the set have in common. Thus an element of {x | P(x)} is an object t for which the statement P(t) is true. Such a sentence P(x) is called a **predicate**, because in English the property is grammatically a **predicate**. P(x) is also called a **propositional function**, because each choice of x produces a proposition P(x) that is either true or false.

### Example 5:
Let A = { x | x is an integer less than 8 }. Here P(x) is the sentence "x is an integer less than 8". Since P(1) is true, 1 $\in$ A.

### Universal quantification:
The **universal quantification** of a predacate P(x) is the statement "For all values of x, P(x) is true". We assume here that only values of x that make sense in P(x) are considered. If we wish to restrict the values of x, we can, for example, write $\forall$ x $\geq$ 0 or $\forall$ n $\in$ Z. The **universal quantification** of P(x) is denoted $\forall$ x P(x). The symbol $\forall$ is called the **universal quantifier**.

### Example 6:
(a) The sentence P(x): -(-x) = x is a predicate that makes sense for real numbers x. The universal quantification of P(x), $\forall$ x P(x), is a true statement, because for all real numbers -(-x) = x.
(b) Let Q(x): x + 1 < 4. Then $\forall$ x $\geq$ 0 Q(x) is a false statement, because Q(100) is not true.

### Existential quantification:
In some situations we only require that there be at least one value for which the predicate is true. The **existential quantification** of a predicate P(x) is the statement "There exists a value x for which P(x) is true". The existential quantification of P(x) is denoted $\exists$ x P(x). The symbol $\exists$ is called the **existential quantifier**. We may include restrictions in the quantifier such as $\exists$ x $\gt$ 0.

### Example 7:
(a) Let Q(x): x + 1 < 4. The existential quantification of Q(x), $\exists$ x Q(x), is a true statement, because Q(0) is a true statement.
(b) The statement $\exists$ y y + 2 = y is false. There is no value of y for which the propositional function y + 2 = y produces a true statement.

### Order of quantifiers:
For a predicate with several variables, we may may apply both universal and existential quantification. In this case the order does matter.

### Example 8:
Let A and B be n x n matrices.
(a) The statement $\forall$ A $\exists$ B (A + B) = $I_n$ is read "for every A there is a B such that A + B = $I_n$". For a given A = $[a_{ij}]$, define B = $[b_{ij}]$ as follows: $b_{ii}$ = 1 - $a_{ii}$, 1 $\leq$ i $\leq$ n and $b_{ij}$ = $-a_{ij}$, i $\neq$ j, 1 $\leq$ i $\leq$ n, 1 $\leq$ j $\leq$ n. Then A + B =$I_n$ and we have shown that $\forall$ A $\exists$ B (A + B) = $I_n$ is a true statement.
(b) $\exists$ B $\forall$ A (A + B) = $I_n$ is the statement "there is a B such that for all A A + B = $I_n$". This statement is false, no single B has this property for all A's.
(c) $\exists$ B $\forall$ A (A + B) = A is true. That B = 0 (identity).

### Negation of quantifiers:
Let p: $\forall$ x P(x). The negation of p is false when p is true and true when p is false. For p to be false, there must be at least one alue x for which P(x) is false. Thus p is false if $\exists$ x ~P(x) is true. On the other hand, if $\exists$ x ~P(x) is false, then for every x, ~P(x) is false, so P(x) is true, that is, $\forall$ x P(x) is true. This shows that **the negation** of p is $\exists$ x ~P(x).
