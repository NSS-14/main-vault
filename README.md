# main-vault

### About this repository:

- This repository will contain the Obsidian main vault in which I store my notes.
- It is a good opportunity to share with the public my vault's structure and the subjects that I have interest in.
- This is also a great way to backup my notes in case my storage fails.

### The structure explained:

- The **atomic concepts** contain very important definitions from various subjects, like mathmeatics and artificial intelligence.
- **Practice zone** is the place in which I am doing exercises and test my knowledge.
- In **digested resources** we find essential information extracted from different sources like pdfs or online courses.
- The **subjects** folder is like the "atomic concepts" one, but more complex and more in detail. It is a subject oriented collection of definitions and theory.
- **Daily notes** are notes that are ordered by the date in which they were taken. They are usually having very random contents, like ideas and things that I want to memorize and review.
- I think that I need a folder named **"Stand alone"** because there are notes that do not have a place is this directory architecture.

### The commits messages meaning:

- Description:
	- I will use some codes for the commits messages.
	- This will make them more meaningful and elegant.
	- The structure will get modified for each new subject added.
	- The first commit will be one exception from the convention.
	- The last exception will be the modification of the README.md.

- Commit structure:
	- " the sections codes affected by the commit, separated by '-' "
	- " the codes of the action that occured, separated by '-' "
	- " optional: a short description of the commit "

- Codes:
	- Section code:
		- Each section code will be made of two parts:
			1. The main folder code.
			2. The subjects codes.
	- Main folder code:
		- Each main folder has a number in its name, thats its code.
