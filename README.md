# main-vault

### About this repository:

- This repository will contain the Obsidian main vault in which I store my notes.
- It is a good opportunity to share with the public my vault's structure and the subjects that I have interest in.
- This is also a great way to backup my notes in case my storage fails.

### The structure explained:

- The **atomic concepts** contain very important definitions from various subjects, like mathmeatics and artificial intelligence.
- **Practice zone** is the place in which I am doing exercises and test my knowledge.
- In **digested resources** we find essential information extracted from different sources like pdfs or online courses.
- The **subjects** folder is like the "atomic concepts" one, but more complex and more in detail. It is a subject oriented collection of definitions and theory.
- **Daily notes** are notes that are ordered by the date in which they were taken. They are usually having very random contents, like ideas and things that I want to memorize and review.
- I think that I need a folder named **"Unsorted"** because the procces of organizing things takes time, and, if I am in hurry to take some note, I can use this folder until I will place the notes in the right place.
